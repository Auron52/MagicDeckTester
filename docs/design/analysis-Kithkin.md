# Kithkin analysis

Deck: `decks/Kithkin/Kithkin.cod` (60 cards, mono-white). Started 2026-11-06.

## Coverage and implementation ledger

Stage 1 coverage found seven missing cards. The deck has no sideboard. Existing
Unexpectedly Absent, Plains, Adaptive Automaton, Metallic Mimic, Aether Vial,
and Mutavault have full coverage, subject to review of their bracket notes and
the viewer decision surface.

| Card | Live Scryfall cost | Work | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wizened Cenn | `{W}{W}` | Other Kithkin +1/+1 lord | Implemented; build running |
| Cenn's Heir | `{1}{W}` | +1/+1 per other attacking Kithkin when trigger resolves, including tokens put in attacking | Implemented; focused combat test compiled |
| Militia's Pride | `{1}{W}` | Optional `{W}` per nontoken attacker; tapped attacking token; viewer choice | Search and viewer implemented; independent review complete |
| Goldmeadow Stalwart | `{W}` | Reveal Kithkin or pay `{3}` additional cost | Implemented; Kindred reveal test compiled |
| Figure of Destiny | `{R/W}` | Persistent three-form activations; six hybrid pips on final cost | Engine, search, viewer, focused tests implemented |
| Knight of Meadowgrain | `{W}{W}` | First strike, lifelink | Implemented; build running |
| Kinsbaile Borderguard | `{1}{W}{W}` | Enters with counters per other Kithkin; death tokens per counter of any kind | Engine and focused tests implemented; independent review complete |

The Stage 2 implementation must preserve two rules details: tokens put onto the
battlefield attacking did not themselves attack (so they do not trigger Pride),
but ARE attacking and can count for Heir's pump when its trigger resolves;
Figure's form-changing abilities do not have a turn-end duration. No new card creates a post-combat
resource, so the deck has no new second-main flag.

Borderguard's entry count includes Militia's Pride: Kindred Enchantment —
Kithkin is a Kithkin permanent even though it is not a creature. Its death
count includes counters in the generic counter list and dedicated counter
fields (for example ice counters), captured before the permanent leaves.

## Verification ledger

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Card review and cost/field audits | Scryfall cost audit 546/546 matched; field audit hard fields passed 695/695; new-card oracle advisories none |
| Clean coverage and optimized build | 13/13 full, no missing or partial; final Release build and 17 focused cases/608 assertions pass |
| Baseline profile | Generated `decks/Kithkin/Kithkin.profile.json` (static keep, no exhaustive table) |
| Own provider and routing audit | `KithkinProvider` selected; `provider_audit.py --check` passes |
| Multi-depth and mismatch checks | Depth 0/3/5 smoke comparison is monotone over 75 shared games; verifier found no nonconv/fd-diverge across 120 games |
| Claude-play sweep and viewer decisions | Viewer runtime audit passed: `dig`, `target`, `vial_charge` all surfaced; 15 fresh-seed Claude games complete with 0 unresolved flags; Mutavault P/T replay now 3/3 |
| Horizon-honest leaf tie-break | 8,000 paired games across 8 blocks at play settings changed zero games; retain the default ON setting |
| Suite cost gate and all three regression tiers | PASS: 794.120 ms/game versus Hinata 8929.427 ms/game (0.09×, limit 3×); all 16 rows accepted and rerun on final binary with unchanged digests |
| Discard evidence and bucket policy | No real cleanup labels; 150 paired games at each d3 b10 and d5 b20 give identical base/inverse play digests and averages; ranking inert at these settings |

## Discard ranking bound

The analyzer's 400-game d3 evidence pass observed zero real cleanup sheds, but
2,608 rollout sheds. Because the labeller sees only real sheds, it returned
`DISCARD_UNLABELLED`. I bounded the invisible ranking against its own inverse
with `MTG_SHED_WORST=1` in a pooled, paired batch of 150 games per arm and depth,
seed 300001. At d3 b10, both arms averaged 4.7000 with identical play digest
`4b9bec8abe09da55`; at d5 b20, both averaged 4.6867 with digest
`60c17d1acf8d026b`. No discard bucket policy can improve these sampled
outcomes at the tested play settings, so Kithkin retains the root ranking.

## Open decisions and assumptions

KithkinProvider explicitly chooses Kithkin for Adaptive Automaton and Metallic
Mimic, as approved by the user. Choosing Kithkin maximizes synergy with Wizened Cenn,
Cenn's Heir, Kinsbaile Borderguard, and Militia's Pride. Their alternative type
choices remain inert against the passive opponent for this list. The 20-game
viewer audit surfaced all expected decision types (`dig`, `target`,
`vial_charge`); no card choice produced a hard miss.

Goldmeadow Stalwart uses the shared reveal-or-pay cost: it reveals whenever a
Kithkin card is available in hand. Revealing is free against this passive
opponent, including when the reveal card is Kindred Militia's Pride; the chosen
reveal card stays in hand. The human viewer does not surface which Kithkin is
revealed or the dominated pay-{3} alternative. The user approved this auto-reveal
policy.

KithkinProvider owns the Automaton/Mimic creature-type heuristic. Routing uses the
Kithkin-only Militia/Borderguard params and Cenn's Heir's Kithkin attack pump.
It deliberately bypasses VialProvider's Sliver cleanup-discard buckets. No
other Kithkin-specific pruning has been adopted.

## Claude-play findings

Fresh-seed games 510003, 510005, and 510007 called the 4/4 Figure of Destiny
activation a missing Spirit prerequisite. This is a false positive: the ability
is legal to activate on a 1/1 Figure; the condition is checked on resolution and
the effect may do nothing. The existing Figure unit test explicitly covers
that case. The plan menu must keep the legal activation.

Games 510005 and 510006 found that the protocol displayed an animated
Mutavault as 2/0 or 3/1 with Wizened Cenn, though its real animated P/T is 2/2
or 3/3. The shared lethal-toughness reader omitted `animate_toughness`; the
protocol's expanded label reader omitted both animation base values. Both
readers were corrected and a focused Mutavault + Cenn assertion was added.
The Kithkin goldfish opponent never deals combat damage, so this is expected
to leave the win-turn baselines unchanged. The final build passed the focused
test (17 cases, 608 assertions), and replaying seed 510012 through decision
prefix 15 now reports Mutavault as 3/3.

Game 510008's reported `land=none`/Plains mismatch was a plan-reading error:
the exact replay at its decision prefix shows selected plan 27 as
`land=Plains`. Figure activations that reset a higher form to 2/2 are legal.

## Claude-play sweep

- commit: `0b0c1c6436b76b99d42226d9df6a1a36440c7893` (Kithkin source was uncommitted in this working tree during the sweep)
- seeds: 510001–510015; games: 15; 12 tied the depth-5 search, three were one turn slower, none faster
- flags: 0 unresolved; the Mutavault protocol P/T defect was fixed and replayed, and Figure/land reports were dismissed against rules and exact replay

## Multi-depth sanity

On the overlapping 75 smoke games (seed block 1001), depth 3 beat depth 0 in
38 games and lost none; depth 5 beat depth 3 in two games and lost none.
The shared turn-7 outlier at game index 57 reproduced with seed 1058. It kept
four Plains, two Unexpectedly Absent, and Borderguard; drew another Plains on
turn 2 and its first one-drop on turn 3. The turn-7 clock follows the slow draw,
not a missing play line.

The final strict reference replay passed 777 saved games: 313 unchanged, 463
intent-repaired, one beaten, and zero play drift, board divergence, enumeration
gaps, mulligan drift, or contract failures. Both suboptimal references remain
strictly beaten. The one-command verifier passed its runtime viewer audit, 120
nonconvergence/fidelity games with no flags, and eight protocol-invariant games
covering 204 decisions.

The ten new Kithkin human references average a turn-4.6 win. At the shipped
depth-5, 20 ms play setting, search matches or beats all ten (three faster;
average turn 4.3). One turn-4 line initially took until turn 5 because the
budgeted root search examined Figure of Destiny before Aether Vial. The Kithkin
provider now ranks a turn-one Vial first when at least two two-mana creatures
are in hand. This changes candidate order only; the searched plans still decide
the play. The regular and overnight per-game audits found no slower searched
games after the change, with two overnight games winning a turn earlier.

Before adopting the exhaustive mulligan profile, across the four overnight
depth-5 play rows, Kithkin wins 7,696 of 7,700
games and averages 4.6301 turns (unwon games score as turn 9). The four depth-0
rows average 5.1174 turns over 8,000 games. These rows use different seed blocks
and sample sizes; the paired 75-game smoke comparison above is the same-seed
depth sanity check.

## Exhaustive mulligan profile

The generator found 13 hand buckets and selected depth 1 with a 3 ms budget
for its rollouts. The accepted table covers 39,945 seven-card compositions and
has bottoming enabled. In paired validation, exhaustive keep improved the
average win turn by 0.1645 over static keep; its bottoming policy improved by
another 0.0545 over lookahead bottoming. Both passed the generator's adoption
gates. The subsequent regression audit showed 202 faster and 75 slower searched
games, and the new baseline was accepted.

## Value leaf and play setting

The value-leaf workflow trained on 11,308 labelled positions and completed
all 52 matrix cells at 400 games each without condemned cells. Its live A/B
selected the final-depth single-pass shape: average win turn improved by
0.00225 across 8,000 paired games while search work fell to 0.397 of the
previous setting. The play-setting grid then adopted depth 6 with a 30 ms
budget. Under that shipped setting, search still matches or beats all ten new
human references, with three earlier wins. The regular regression audit found
four faster searched games and none slower; strict replay passed all 777 saved
references with no protocol drift. The smoke and regular baselines were accepted.

### Pending user sign-off (block the gate until fixed OR approved below)
_none_ -- every blocking gate is green or already signed off.

### Stage 6a disclosure (deferrals + not-yet-built checks)
- coverage deferral -- Unexpectedly Absent: Targeting::NonlandPermanent (approved full scope 2026-08-13). Opponent target: every spawn is a TOKEN, so it ceases on leaving the battlefield (CR 111.7) -- the erase is faithful, X irrelevant there. Own target: a real Library::insert at min(X, size) (the Stoneforge-reset line). Pruned search: X=0 only (higher X provably never better for either use) and opponent-creature targets only (self-tuck approved-lean per user); MTG_UNPRUNED / human play opens the full X range and every nonland permanent incl. own side.
- coverage deferral -- Adaptive Automaton: GENERIC -- the type is not baked in. CLAUSE 1: ETB choice via the shared DominantCreatureSubtypeId at FireEtbWatchers -> Permanent::chosen_subtype_id (deck-constant; not surfaced -- same weak-dominance argument and PROVISIONAL inert-gap disclosure as Metallic Mimic). CLAUSE 2: chosen_type_added_to_self appends the chosen id to the BATTLEFIELD permanent's subtypes only -- so it receives Corsair Captain's +1/+1 and other Automatons' +1/+1, counts for Dire Fleet Captain, triggers Forerunner, and gets Metallic Mimic's counter; in hand/library it is only a Construct. CLAUSE 3: lord_effect with lord_affects_chosen_subtype (ComputeLordBonus matches creatures carrying THIS permanent's chosen_subtype_id instead of a static subtypes_affected list), +1/+1, lord_excludes_self by address, so N Automatons each get +(N-1). Known narrowing: hand-card VALUATION heuristics score an Automaton/Mimic in hand from its printed card (no chosen type yet) -- move-ordering only; the lookahead runs the real enter code.
- coverage deferral -- Metallic Mimic: GENERIC -- the type is not baked in. CLAUSE 1 (choose a creature type): chosen_type_added_to_self makes the ETB choice at the universal enter cascade (FireEtbWatchers) via the shared DominantCreatureSubtypeId -> Permanent::chosen_subtype_id (Pirate in Pirates), identical in executor and rollout, cast or Aether Vial put. Deck-constant, so not surfaced to the human: the deck's own tribe weakly dominates every alternative for this card (both its effects touch only creatures you control, and nothing in the list penalises a type). PROVISIONAL inert-gap disclosure. CLAUSE 2 (is the chosen type in addition): the chosen id is APPENDED to the BATTLEFIELD permanent's own subtypes, never the printed card -- so on the battlefield Mimic IS a Pirate (Corsair Captain's and Adaptive Automaton's lords, Dire Fleet Captain's attacking-Pirate count, Forerunner of the Coalition's 'another Pirate enters' drain) while in hand/library it is only a Shapeshifter (not a Forerunner tutor target, not a Pirate for a reveal cost; Staunch Crewmate can still take it as an ARTIFACT). CLAUSE 3 is a CR 614 REPLACEMENT: other_chosen_subtype_enters_counters 1, applied in FireEtbWatchers' as-enters counter block AFTER the entrant's own type choice and ABOVE the enter-trigger watchers, so a second Mimic / an Adaptive Automaton naming the same type enters with the counter (CR 614.12) and the counter is on the body before any enter trigger reads it. 'Other' by permanent address. Simultaneous-enter ruling (a creature entering WITH Mimic gets no counter) is inert: the engine resolves enters one at a time and nothing in this list puts Mimic and a Pirate onto the battlefield simultaneously.
- coverage deferral -- Aether Vial: AI policy. CHARGE: the shared hand-aware rule WantVialCharge (executor and rollout alike) -- HOLD while an undeployed creature in hand has mana value equal to the counters (from two counters up; it climbs instead when the next level also holds a creature, unless this level holds two or more extra), else CLIMB while a creature in hand has a higher mana value, else pre-charge toward the deck's charge target (vial_target_mv: the most common creature mana value in the list, ties going up). The charge is not a searched decision (the searched charge axis MTG_VIAL_AXIS ships OFF, USER ruling 2026-08-30). PUT: searched -- one main-phase action per creature card in hand whose mana value equals the counters, both mains.
- coverage deferral -- Mutavault: No haste: an animated Mutavault is subject to summoning sickness unless it has been controlled since before this turn or a haste lord (Cloudshredder Sliver) is in play.
