# Cyclone completion checkpoint — 2026-10-30

User scope: finish outstanding changes in `origin/cyclone-analysis:docs/design/cyclone-branches-and-next-steps.md`, then re-evaluate. Do not start mulligan/value generation before that review.

Working branch/worktree: `cyclone-finish`, `.claude/worktrees/cyclone-finish`, branched from `origin/cyclone-int` (3892d2159), rebasing onto current phase-1-2 6b655b71f. Original backup branches untouched. Primary checkout has an existing unrelated `test/ref_bench.json` edit; preserve it.

Current stage: rebase complete, HEAD 6c8a68c70. Skipped obsolete GT-only f586cb53b; retained current-main GT as one consistent measurement (883 rows, zero stale/missing). Resolved engine/viewer conflicts preserving both changes, including BoundaryFan extra-turn depth restoration and meter-only census accounting. First post-rebase Release build is running, log primary build/scratch/cyclone-finish/rebase-build.log. Unit/scenarios/smoke pending before queued picks. Build only via build.sh; all recreatable output under primary build/scratch/cyclone-finish. Prior machine's scratch manifests/binaries are absent: reconstruct from tracked ledgers, rerun paired baselines on current integrated source.

Independent reviews found extra required fixes:

- KEEP_AMEND reads library size/land count but CantripOrderKey omits them. Add both inputs with a same-board/different-library unit and rank-cache VERIFY run.
- Two-Eldrazi JUNK fix 0b8c27fbb appears right; add explicit k=1 and k=0 JUNK coverage (existing test is k=3; other k=0 test covers SETUP).
- Q61 SeedPaySplits incomplete for partial floating mana; special-source signatures may fold distinct capabilities, Cascade Bluffs colourless face omitted; all-generic guards incomplete. Current-main PayContextDigest must include new seed-payment holds. Payment review agent drafting corrective patch in build/scratch/cyclone-finish/q61.
- Q64 REV_CYCLERS rank 5 is before draws; proposed after-draw/before-Song order requires separate rank ~55 arm.
- Viewer branch has an unfixed wide-board valve regression: EDF claude_s5_gi4 T4 loses existing Mariposa group. Exclude added generic-cycle groups before old valve, append within caps. menu-prefix checker currently exits zero even on failure; repair before using as gate.
- Cache design remains interim 512MB/thread; broader floor+shared-overflow work belongs to cache audit, not a claim of completion here.

Queued picks after rebase:

- prunes: a6766244f e672a8f73 cd8bd730b 9764ea0b8 0b8c27fbb (then test PB before flip)
- cost: 479bb66b6 76a733712
- castorder: 03baf1a73 9066f252d 6e887cbe5 b3f5abd88
- viewer: a89fd7ca2 dbe51e677
- docs from cyclone-analysis: a7ae8e4ce 66ded5bd7 5123a5425 f93a87ce5 (inspect parents/needed docs first)

Validation: unit/scenarios/smoke per group; full regression and viewer protocol/validate/menu-prefix; pooled PB/KEEP/SITU/SEED/blind and cast-order/Q64/payment A/B; memory t1/t6/t12 and tiny12 equality in wins/digests/units. Finish outstanding QC1/QC3/nested-exhaust measurements without deciding user-owned settings unilaterally. Final quiet-box bottoming-ON cost gate against same-run current Hinata. No MTG_BOTTOM_ROLLOUTS=0.

USER steering 2026-10-30: fixed 512MB/thread plan-cache policy is unwanted going forward. Prefer landing Cyclone before cache budgeting; do budgeting first only if necessary. Audit whether exact-key/hit-equals-miss fixes can retain existing shared budgets, then prove with tiny/global-pool thread invariance. Do not simply substitute another fixed quota. Current rebase conflict resolution also preserves main's meter-only census sites and enummemo::BodyScope around cached derivations; budget-units sum excludes only meter-only sites, not newly appended cache-hit site.
